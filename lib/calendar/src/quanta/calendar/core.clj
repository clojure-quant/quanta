(ns quanta.calendar.core)

; to find a calendar we use one vector param: [:forex :d]

; the ns should have 

; in quanta.calendar.db there should be
; one function to load a calendar

; and then in quanta.calendar.core we only use a loaded calendar.
; this avoids many error checkings, I guess.

;; all function should have docstrings and be tested.
