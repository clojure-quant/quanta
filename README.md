# trateg

Trateg is an experimental platform for backtesting and analyzing financial instrument trading strategies in clojure.

Seeks to provide tools to run backtests on financial time series and analyze results.

Provides a light convenience wrapper over [ta4j](https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j) as well as a very early attempt at a pure clojure implementation of something similar.
