Trateg is an experimental platform for backtesting and analyzing financial instrument trading strategies in clojure.

Seeks to provide tools to run backtests on financial time series and analyze results.

Provides a light convenience wrapper over [ta4j](https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j) as well as a very early attempt at a pure clojure implementation of something similar. 

## Usage

See the [examples](dev/examples) directory for some usage examples.

## PinkGorilla Notebook

TA ships some sample-notebooks that you can edit in PinkGorilla notebook.
In your IDE, jack-in to a new repl with +notebook profile.

The advantage of running the notebook in the IDE is that changed code in the TA library will be reflected in the notebook; this helps TA development.

For testing you can also run pink-gorilla standalone:
```
lein notebook
```


## run unit tests / speed tests

```
lein test
lein speed
```
