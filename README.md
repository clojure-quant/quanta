# ta [![GitHub Actions status |pink-gorilla/trateg](https://github.com/pink-gorilla/trateg/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pink-gorilla/trateg/actions?workflow=CI)[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.pinkgorilla/ta.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.pinkgorilla/ta)

Trateg is an experimental platform for backtesting and analyzing financial instrument trading strategies in clojure.

Seeks to provide tools to run backtests on financial time series and analyze results.

Provides a light convenience wrapper over [ta4j](https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j) as well as a very early attempt at a pure clojure implementation of something similar. 

## Demo - GoldlyDocs Web app

See the [profiles/demo] directory for some usage examples.

TA ships a goldly web-app. 

Goto demo directory: `cd profiles/demo`

Run the demos
 - run: `clj -X:goldly-docs`
 - in webbrowser go to localhost:8000 
 - nrepl server is running on port 9100  (in vscode called nrepl jack in)  

** add datasource credentials **

create this file: profiles/demo/creds.edn - then add your secret key in this format:
{:alphavantage "YOUR-SECRET-KEY"}

## bybit import

Goto demo directory: `cd profiles/demo`

- once:  `clj -X:bybit-import-initial`
- every 15 minutes / whenever you want to update. (missing a bar cannot happen)
 `clj -X:bybit-import-append`
